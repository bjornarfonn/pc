Pond Control is a garden automation project with sensors, feeder, water level control for my Koi pond. 

Features:
- Keeps a precise water level so you never risk overflowing the pond. 
- The water fill flow is monitored over time to detect leaks or suspiciously high water usage. 
- Monitors water temperature which controls the fish feeding frequency. 
- Monitors the PH value in realtime and signals if counter measures should be taken (too high/low). Good range is PH 7.8 - 8.2
- Watering plants and bushes near the pond with sprinkler system
